# Bachpan

**Bachpan** is a small but heartfelt project aiming to support children who are struggling with toxic parenting, while also guiding parents toward more empathetic and healthy behavior. This is just a landing page for now — a starting point for something bigger.

## 🌈 Purpose

Many children grow up feeling unheard, unloved, or mentally hurt by the people who should protect them. Bachpan is a step toward creating a safe space — where both kids and parents can seek help, grow, and heal.


## 🚀 Features (Planned)

- Informative sections for both children and parents  
- Soothing visuals and messages for emotional support  
- Anonymous community chat (in future versions)  
- Tools and guides for personal growth  

## ⚒️ Tech Stack

- **HTML**  
- **CSS**  
- **JavaScript**  
- **AOS (Animate on Scroll)** for subtle animations  
- **LottieFiles** for future motion graphics (optional)

## ⚠️ Limitations

- Not responsive (yet)  
- Static only (no backend)  
- Work in progress!
